# Secret Wars

What started out as a side-project ended up becoming something important to me.

Currently, and for the last 15 years, the US has been conducting covert drone strikes in Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan,
three countries with which we do not have formal declarations of war.

This website takes the dronestream API and presents the data using AngularJS.


##Installation

There really isn't anything special. All the dependencies are included as links in the index.html file.


##Usage:

Spread the word. Only through public education and attention is it possible to make changes in the world.


##Contributing

Please fork, add, create. This project is already an extension of the existing dronestream project.
